# DependNG.resolve
Automated mod-dependency resolving for BeamNG.

## More Info / detailed instructions:
[Toemmsen.ch Website](https://toemmsen.ch/posts/dependency_resolver/)

## DependNG Installer UI
This now features a DependNG installer UI for easy integration into your own mod.

To use, load it with GMSG / MultiSlot's UI in the Utils-Tab under the advanced options.
As an alternative, you can load it by entering `extensions.load("tommot_dependnginstaller")` in the game's console.

You only need this to be installed in your game for it to work (It will automatically install GMSG / MultiSlot if it isn't already, may change in the future)


A full documentation on the website is on the way.
