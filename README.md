# gmsgDownloader
 Automatically downloads GMSG / Multislot if not found, just needs to be added to Plugins.

## Dependency Resolver Installer UI
This now features a dependency installer UI for easy integration into your own mod.

To use, load it with GMSG / MultiSlot's UI in the Utils-Tab under the advanced options.
As an alternative, you can load it by entering `extensions.load("tommot_depInstallerUi")` in the game's console.

You only need this to be installed in your game for it to work (It will automatically install GMSG / MultiSlot if it isn't already, may change in the future)


A full documentation on the website is on the way.

## Usage for other mods
This kind of acts like a simple version of dependency resolving and can be easily adjusted to work for other mods etc. 
### Stuff needed to change for own mods (ONLY NEEDED IF DOING MANUALLY WITHOUT UI)
- Copy the lua and script folders with its content to the root of your mod

- Choose a fitting name, for example the required-mod-ID+Downloader as "modname"
âž¡ Here we take gmsgDownloader as "modname" instead, from here always enter your chosen "modname"
- change foldername from /scripts/gmsgDownloader to /scripts/"modname"
- change /lua/ge/extensions/tommot/gmsgDownloader.lua to /lua/ge/extensions/"yourname"/"modname".lua
- edit the following line in /scripts/"modname"/modScript.lua so this reflects your name and modname 
```lua 
setExtensionUnloadMode("'yourname'_'modname'","manual")
```
