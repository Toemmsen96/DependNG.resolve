# gmsgDownloader
 Automatically downloads GMSG / Multislot if not found, just needs to be added to Plugins.

âž¡ Here we take gmsgDownloader as "modname" instead, from here always enter your chosen "modname"
- change foldername from /scripts/gmsgDownloader to /scripts/"modname"
- change /lua/ge/extensions/tommot/gmsgDownloader.lua to /lua/ge/extensions/"yourname"/"modname".lua
- edit the following line in /scripts/"modname"/modScript.lua so this reflects your name and modname 
```lua 
setExtensionUnloadMode("'yourname'/'modname'","manual")
```
